If enabled the driver will throw an exception for a queries issued on a stale or dead connection, which belong to the current transaction, but will attempt reconnect before the next query issued on the connection in a new transaction. The use of this feature is not recommended, because it has side effects related to session state and data consistency when applications don't handle SQLExceptions properly, and is only designed to be used when you are unable to configure your application to handle SQLExceptions resulting from dead and stale connections properly. Alternatively, as a last option, investigate setting the MySQL server variable ""wait_timeout"" to a high value, rather than the default of 8 hours.        ",,,,,,,,,,,,

Security,passwordCharacterEncoding,No,,alpha,5.1.7,"            What character encoding is used for passwords? Leaving this set to the default value (null), uses the value set in ""characterEncoding"" if there is one, otherwise uses UTF-8 as default encoding. If the password contains non-ASCII characters, the password encoding must match what server encoding was set to when the password was created. For passwords in other character encodings, the encoding will have to be specified with this property (or with ""characterEncoding""), as it's not possible for the driver to auto-detect this.

Performance Extensions,alwaysSendSetIsolation,No,TRUE,2147483647,3.1.7,"            Should the driver always communicate with the database when Connection.setTransactionIsolation() is called? If set to false, the driver will only communicate with the database when the requested transaction isolation is different than the whichever is newer, the last value that was set via Connection.setTransactionIsolation(), or the value that was read from the server when the connection was established.  Note that useLocalSessionState=true will force the same behavior as alwaysSendSetIsolation=false, regardless of how alwaysSendSetIsolation is set.        ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,maintainTimeStats,No,TRUE,2147483647,3.1.9,            Should the driver maintain various internal timers to enable idle time calculations as well as more verbose error messages when the connection to the server fails?

",,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,dontTrackOpenResources,No,FALSE,alpha,3.1.7,"            The JDBC specification requires the driver to automatically track and close resources, however if your application doesn't do a good job of explicitly calling close() on statements or result sets, this can cause memory leakage. Setting this property to true relaxes this constraint, and can be more memory efficient for some applications. Also the automatic closing of the Statement and current ResultSet in Statement.closeOnCompletion() and Statement.getMoreResults ([Statement.CLOSE_CURRENT_RESULT | Statement.CLOSE_ALL_RESULTS]), respectively, ceases to happen. This property automatically sets holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose=true.        ",,,,,,,,,,,,

Performance Extensions,elideSetAutoCommits,No,FALSE,alpha,3.1.3,"            If using MySQL-4.1 or newer, should the driver only issue 'set autocommit=n' queries when the server's state doesn't match the requested state by Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean)?        ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,enableEscapeProcessing,No,TRUE,alpha,5.1.37,            Sets the default escape processing behavior for Statement objects. The method Statement.setEscapeProcessing() can be used to specify the escape processing behavior for an individual Statement object. Default escape processing behavior in prepared statements must be defined with the property 'processEscapeCodesForPrepStmts'.        ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,enableQueryTimeouts,No,TRUE,alpha,5.0.6,"            When enabled, query timeouts set via Statement.setQueryTimeout() use a shared java.util.Timer instance for scheduling. Even if the timeout doesn't expire before the query is processed, there will be memory used by the TimerTask for the given timeout which won't be reclaimed until the time the timeout would have expired if it hadn't been cancelled by the driver. High-load environments might want to consider disabling this functionality.        ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose,No,FALSE,alpha,3.1.7,            Should the driver close result sets on Statement.close() as required by the JDBC specification?        ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,largeRowSizeThreshold,No,2048,alpha,5.1.1,"            What size result set row should the JDBC driver consider ""large"", and thus use a more memory-efficient way of representing the row internally?        ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,loadBalanceStrategy,No,random,alpha,5.0.6,"            If using a load-balanced connection to connect to SQL nodes in a MySQL Cluster/NDB configuration (by using the URL prefix ""jdbc:mysql:loadbalance://""), which load balancing algorithm should the driver use: (1) ""random"" - the driver will pick a random host for each request. This tends to work better than round-robin, as the randomness will somewhat account for spreading loads where requests vary in response time, while round-robin can sometimes lead to overloaded nodes if there are variations in response times across the workload. (2) ""bestResponseTime"" - the driver will route the request to the host that had the best response time for the previous transaction. (3) ""serverAffinity"" - the driver initially attempts to enforce server affinity while still respecting and benefiting from the fault tolerance aspects of the load-balancing implementation. The server affinity ordered list is provided using the property 'serverAffinityOrder'. If none of the servers listed in the affinity list is responsive, the driver then refers to the ""random"" strategy to proceed with choosing the next server.        ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,locatorFetchBufferSize,No,1048576,alpha,3.2.1,"            If 'emulateLocators' is configured to 'true', what size buffer should be used when fetching BLOB data for getBinaryInputStream?        ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,readOnlyPropagatesToServer,No,TRUE,alpha,5.1.35,"            Should the driver issue appropriate statements to implicitly set the transaction access mode on server side when Connection.setReadOnly() is called? Setting this property to 'true' enables InnoDB read-only potential optimizations but also requires an extra roundtrip to set the right transaction state. Even if this property is set to 'false', the driver will do its best effort to prevent the execution of database-state-changing queries. Requires minimum of MySQL 5.6.        ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Extensions,rewriteBatchedStatements,No,FALSE,alpha,3.1.13,"            Should the driver use multiqueries (irregardless of the setting of ""allowMultiQueries"") as well as rewriting of prepared statements for INSERT into multi-value inserts when executeBatch() is called? Notice that this has the potential for SQL injection if using plain java.sql.Statements and your code doesn't sanitize input correctly. Notice that for prepared statements, server-side prepared statements can not currently take advantage of this rewrite option, and that if you don't specify stream lengths when using PreparedStatement.set*Stream(), the driver won't be able to determine the optimum number of parameters per batch and you might receive an error from the driver that the resultant packet is too large. Statement.getGeneratedKeys() for these rewritten statements only works when the entire batch includes INSERT statements. Please be aware using rewriteBatchedStatements=true with INSERT .. ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE that for rewritten statement server returns only one value as sum of all affected (or found) rows in batch and it isn't possible to map it correctly to initial statements; in this case driver returns 0 as a result of each batch statement if total count was 0, and the Statement.SUCCESS_NO_INFO as a result of each batch statement if total count was > 0.

Miscellaneous,tinyInt1isBit,No,TRUE,alpha,3.0.16,            Should the driver treat the datatype TINYINT(1) as the BIT type (because the server silently converts BIT -> TINYINT(1) when creating tables)?        ,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miscellaneous,transformedBitIsBoolean,No,FALSE,alpha,3.1.9,"            If the driver converts TINYINT(1) to a different type, should it use BOOLEAN instead of BIT for future compatibility with MySQL-5.0, as MySQL-5.0 has a BIT type?        ",,,,,,,,,,,,

Miscellaneous,useLegacyDatetimeCode,No,TRUE,alpha,5.1.6,"            Use code for DATE/TIME/DATETIME/TIMESTAMP handling in result sets and statements that consistently handles time zone conversions from client to server and back again, or use the legacy code for these datatypes that has been in the driver for backwards-compatibility? Setting this property to 'false' voids the effects of ""useTimezone,"" ""useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift,"" ""useGmtMillisForDatetimes,"" and ""useFastDateParsing.""        ",,,,,,,,,,,,
Miscellaneous,useOldAliasMetadataBehavior,No,FALSE,alpha,5.0.4,"            Should the driver use the legacy behavior for ""AS"" clauses on columns and tables, and only return aliases (if any) for ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName() or ResultSetMetaData.getTableName() rather than the original column/table name?
